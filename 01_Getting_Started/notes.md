## BIG WORD ALERT (BWA)
- **BWA** stands for "BIG WORD ALERT." In computer science and programming, we often use terms that sound more complicated than they really are. Throughout this course, we'll introduce these terms and break them down to make sure you're not intimidated by them.
  
  ### Example of a BIG WORD:
  - **BIG WORD**: "Execution Context"
  - **Definition**: The environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. 
  - **Further Detail**: This refers to the context (or scope) in which a piece of code runs and has access to certain resources such as variables or functions.

### Summary
- This section introduces how the course will use the BWA concept to help you understand terms better and not feel overwhelmed by technical jargon.
