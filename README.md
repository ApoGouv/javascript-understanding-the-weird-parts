# JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
This repository contains my notes, exercises, and examples from the course "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts" by Anthony Alicea. Revisiting the fundamentals to strengthen my understanding and ensure Iâ€™m staying on top of how the language truly works.

## About the Course
This course dives deep into JavaScript, offering a clear understanding of how the language works under the hood. It covers both foundational and advanced concepts, helping developers avoid common pitfalls, debug effectively, and write better code.

Key topics include:
- Objects, prototypes, and inheritance
- Function expressions, closures, and scope chains
- Functional programming principles
- Key ES6 features and their use cases
- Building your own JavaScript framework or library

Through hands-on examples, you'll explore the inner workings of popular frameworks like jQuery and Underscore, gaining insights into their design and functionality. By the end of the course, you'll have a stronger grasp of JavaScript and its modern applications in frameworks, libraries, and server-side technologies like Node.js.
